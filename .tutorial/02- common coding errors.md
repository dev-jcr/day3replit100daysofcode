- An easy mistake to make is to forget one or more commas.
- Remember that you need a `,` ***between*** each different object you're trying to print out.
- Without `,` the computer gets confused and shows an error.

## Your code may run...but look weird
ðŸ‘‰ This code would *actually run*, but...



```python
yourName = input("Name: ")
whatYear = input("What year is it?: ")
print("yourName, thinks it is, whatYear")
```
give this output. What's weird about this code?
```
Name: Mark
What year is it?: 2431
yourname, thinks it is, whatYear
```

  - Another common error occurs when you wrap the entire thing in **quotes** `(".., .., .. ")`.
  - This *actually runs*, but doesn't quite do what you want.
  - Everything in `(".., .., .. ")` gets printed *literally*.
  - Since the variable names are alo within quotes `(".., .., .. ")`, it's literally printing the names rather than the contents.
    - The only thing in quotes should be the *literal* strings `print(varName, "literal string", varName2)`.
